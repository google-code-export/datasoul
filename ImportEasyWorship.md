There is also a tool available that import all your songs from EasyWorship to Datasoul.

You need to have both EasyWorship and Datasoul installed on the same computer. If you are willing to move to another platform (such as Linux or Mac), you have to first install Datasoul on the Windows machine, perform the import and then copy the Datasoul files to the new platform.
