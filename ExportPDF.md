# Create Service Printouts #

Once you create a service plan, choosing the songs and texts in the proper sequence, Datasoul can create printouts containing:

  * A summary of the service (the events in their order, along with notes)
  * Text for all text items (such as messages and bible texts)
  * Lyrics and Chords for the songs
  * Guitar Tabs used by the selected songs

This way, once you pick a song for the service you can quickly create a document with all needed chords and guitar tabs to send to musicians to practice in advance.

If you prefer, you can export the printout as RTF file, which can be edited using OpenOffice Writer or Microsoft Word.

# Export Slides in PDF #

You can also export the slides in PDF. They will appear in the file the exact way they would be displayed in the screen.

The generated file can be presented using most PDF readers in full screen, without need for installing Datasoul.
